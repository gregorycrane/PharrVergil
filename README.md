# PharrVergil

This repository includes work for a possible digital version of Clyde Pharr's 1930 edition of Vergil's Aeneid (books 1-6). Pharr was one of the most thoughtful teachers of Greek and Latin in the twentieth century. His [Beginning Homeric Greek book](https://archive.org/details/PharrBeginningHomericGreek1920), publishedin 1920, was pioneering piece of data-driven work and allows learners to begin engaging with the opening of the Iliad within a few weeks of study (or sooner in an intensive setting).
